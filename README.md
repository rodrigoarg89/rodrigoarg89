- 👋 Hi, I’m Rodrigo Argañaraz
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning in depth frontend and backend web development technology. My goal is to become one of the best 
Latin American programmers within 3 years. I would love to work in a great company where I can continue developing my knowledge, 
learn many new ones, and also that allows me to continue developing my technical and interpersonal skills.
      I am a very restless person, what I don't know today, I am looking for the necessary information to have it learned tomorrow!
Self-taught from a very young age, always open to new challenges!
Thanks for viewing my readme!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on companies that use web development technology to its full potential, mainly, since that will give 
- me the opportunity to be in the right place to develop as one of the best programmers both in the company and outside of it.
