# 👋 Hi, I’m Rodrigo Argañaraz
     I’m a full stack developer with experience in React.js, Redux, HTML, Javascript, css, Node.js and postgreSQL.
     
# 👀 I’m interested in learning in depth frontend and backend web development technology. 
     My goal is to become one of the best 
     Latin American programmers within 3 years. I would love to work in a great company where I can continue developing my knowledge, 
     learn many new ones, and also that allows me to continue developing my technical and interpersonal skills.
      I am a very restless person, what I don't know today, I am looking for the necessary information to have it learned tomorrow!
     Self-taught from a very young age, always open to new challenges!
     Thanks for viewing my readme!

# 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native!

# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate 
     on companies that use web development technology to its full potential, mainly, since that will give 
     me the opportunity to be in the right place to develop as one of the best programmers both in the company and outside of it.
